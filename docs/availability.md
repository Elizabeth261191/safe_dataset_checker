# Data availability

When your dataset is published, the **metadata** will be always immediately publicly visible on Zenodo. This includes details of the data fields, the spatial scope, the date range and the like.

We would prefer that as much data as possible is submitted as **Open access** , but if
you want to restrict access to the data while you work on papers, then you can specify an
**Embargo period** of up to two years. The metadata will still be visible, so that
researchers can see that the data exists but any data files will only become available once
the embargo date has passed.

Obviously, you can choose to provide embargoed data to other researchers within the embargo
period. If researchers contact the SAFE Project for access to data during the embargo period,
we will **always** pass the request on to you.

For details on setting the access status, see [here](data_format/summary.md#access-status).

# Data administration

All of the data submitted through SAFE is published through a single administrative Zenodo account (`the_safe_project`). This central account is purely used for data curation so that we can always access datafiles, update records and act as a final point of contact for data. This helps us ensure the long-term availability and maintenance of the SAFE data repository.

This is entirely separate from the authorship and ownership of the data: the citation for the data will always be to the original set of authors provided in the metadata. We will never make embargoed data available and we will always consult data authors about issues arising with their datasets.
