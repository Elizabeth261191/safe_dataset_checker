# Data availability

When your dataset is published, the metadata will be immediately publicly visible on Zenodo. This
includes details of the data fields, the spatial scope, the date range and the like. 

We would prefer that as much data as possible is submitted as **Open access** , but if
you want to restrict access to the data while you work on papers, then you can specify an
**Embargo period** of up to two years. The metadata will still be visible, so that
researchers can see that the data exists but any data files will only become available once
the embargo date has passed.

Obviously, you can choose to provide embargoed data to other researchers within the embargo
period. If researchers contact the SAFE Project for access to data during the embargo period,
we will **always** pass the request on to you.

For details on setting the access status, see [here](data_format/summary.md#Access_status).
